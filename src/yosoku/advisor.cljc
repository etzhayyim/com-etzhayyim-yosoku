(ns yosoku.advisor
  "SD-Advisor — the *contained intelligence node*. Drafts either a brand-new
  System-Dynamics model (`:model/propose`), a caller-specified scenario
  patch (`:scenario/propose`), or — real-LLM only — an open-ended scenario
  recommendation from a natural-language `:intent` (`:scenario/advise`),
  using `kotoba-lang/org-oasis-open-xmile`'s EDN model shape. CRITICAL: like
  gftd-talent-actor's HR-LLM, it is a smart-but-untrusted advisor — it
  returns a *proposal*, never a committed model. Every output is censored
  downstream by `yosoku.governor` before anything touches the SSoT.

  `mock-advisor` is a deterministic mock so the actor graph runs offline end
  to end and the governor contract is exercised without any network/API
  dependency — the default everywhere, including for `:scenario/advise`
  (which it cannot meaningfully reason about, so it safely no-ops).
  `llm-advisor` (bottom of this file) wires a real `langchain.model/
  ChatModel` against the Murakumo fleet (DEFAULT-PREFERRED per Rider v3.3
  §2(i), same allowlist as `tashikame.advisor`/`kouhou.advisor`) for
  `:scenario/advise`; `:model/propose`/`:scenario/propose` still route
  through the deterministic `infer` regardless of which advisor is
  injected — an LLM drafting a WHOLE new XMILE model from scratch is out of
  scope (per `yosoku.models`' own docstring, a real deployment seeds new
  models from an operator's authoring tool, not an LLM), and a caller-
  specified `:change` needs no open-ended reasoning to relay.
