(ns yosoku.scenario
  "Pure helpers for applying a proposed scenario PATCH to a base XMILE model
  (kotoba-lang/org-oasis-open-xmile EDN shape) to build the CANDIDATE model
  the ScenarioGovernor validates/simulates before anything commits. No I/O,
  no store, no advisor — just data, so it is trivially unit-testable and
  reusable by both `yosoku.governor` (to build the candidate to censor) and
  `yosoku.store` (to actually apply an approved patch to the SSoT).

  A patch is:
    {:variables {var-name {:xmile/eqn \"...\"} ...}   ; per-variable overrides
     :sim-specs {:xmile/stop 36 ...}}                  ; sim_specs overrides
  Both keys are optional; a nil/empty patch is a no-op (candidate == base).

  `apply-patch` is intentionally DEFENSIVE: a patch key naming a variable
  that does not exist in the base model is silently ignored here (never
  fabricates a new variable via a scenario patch — introducing a variable is
  what `:model/propose` is for). `yosoku.governor` independently flags any
  such key as an `:unknown-variable` violation, so the two concerns don't
  silently overlap: the candidate never drifts from the base on an unknown
  key, and the governor still tells you it happened."

(defn apply-patch

  nil is a no-op (returns nil) — callers with no base (e.g. a `:model/propose`
  with no prior model at that id) never reach this fn."
