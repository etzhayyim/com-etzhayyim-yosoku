(defn etzhayyim-substrate-rollout
  "A real deployment scenario (not a governor-contract fixture like the three
  above): 11 stocks tracking rollout maturity of the etzhayyim mission
  charter's parallel-substrate layers (90-docs/adr/2605192100-etzhayyim-
  mission-charter.md §1.12) — CouncilSeats (governance legitimacy, 0-5),
  TreasuryCapacity (junbi reserve pipeline, 0-100), IdentityCoverage
  (did:web/did:plc/SBT issuance, 0-100), AgentCapacity (real, non-mock
  LLM-agent administrative throughput, 0-100), SocialCoverage (real, non-
  synthetic mimamori/hagukumi/Basic-High-Income delivery, 0-100),
  RoboticsUnits (deployed kuni-umi/watatsumi fleet, 0-100), PublicTrust (a
  reinforcing-loop stock: delivered SocialCoverage/RoboticsUnits/
  DisputeResolutionCoverage feed back into faster CouncilOnboarding),
  ContractLawCoverage (Solidity smart contracts + Constitution.sol
  ratification, 0-100), LandTrustCoverage (Religious-Corp Land Trust real-
  estate holdings, 0-100), EducationCoverage (open-* apps + agent-fleet
  education reach, 0-100), DisputeResolutionCoverage (Council-based
  adjudication + transparency/audit-trail compliance — deliberately NOT
  wired to RoboticsUnits/physical force anywhere in this model; the
  charter's own \"Transparent Religious Force\" framing is transparency-
  based, not a coercive-capability stock, and this model does not represent
  one, 0-100).

  Each downstream flow's equation multiplies in `MIN(1, upstream/threshold)`
  terms — the dependency DAG (u -> v = v's growth requires u's stock level
  as an operating input) made computational, so `xmile.execute/run` and
  ScenarioGovernor-mediated `:scenario/propose` patches double as a
  structural/reverse-topological-sort analysis tool, not just a forecast.
  LandTrustCoverage also gates FleetDeployment/CoverageExpansion (physical
  depots/care facilities), and EducationCoverage softly boosts
  AgentOnboarding's rate (human-capital -> agent-capacity pipeline) rather
  than hard-gating it.

  Eight aux constants are the model's real point — each is a *self-imposed*
  policy gate, not a missing-capability gate: `LegalActivationGate` (junbi
  CBDC/fiat activation — documented as \"an ops/legal act, not code\"),
  `RealLLMWiringGate` (mock-advisor -> real Murakumo inference),
  `G7ConsentGate` (mimamori's own documented \"live legs G7-gated\" self
  -limit), `DispatchGate` (kuni-umi's own documented S0 \"no robots
  dispatched\"), `ConstitutionRatificationGate` (Council ratifying
  Constitution.sol as binding), `LandAcquisitionGate` (real-estate capital
  deployment), `CurriculumGate` (education-content authorization),
  `AdjudicationAuthorityGate` (Council accepting binding-adjudication
  liability). All eight start near 0 — the model's baseline trajectory
  reproduces the 2026-07-13 audit finding that growth is capped by
  self-imposed policy gates, not by missing capability (TreasuryCapacity
  and CouncilSeats — the least-gated stocks — still climb steadily).
  `ComplianceFloor`/`RegulatoryCap` are the two governor-protected constants
  (governor.cljc's default `protected-variables`), standing in for the
  charter's own explicit self-limit (\"国家転覆ではない\" — not a
  nation-overthrow) — no `:scenario/propose` patch may ever touch them,
  structurally, regardless of who or what proposes it; every stock in this
  model (including DisputeResolutionCoverage) saturates at the same 100
  ceiling as everything else, with no separate escalation path.

  See 90-docs/adr/2607132200-etzhayyim-post-nation-state-substrate-system-
  dynamics-reverse-toposort.md and its amendment ADR (com-junkawasaki
  superproject) for the full structural analysis, per-gate leverage
  scoring, and reverse-topological build-order this model backs."
